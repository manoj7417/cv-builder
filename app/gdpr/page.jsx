                <strong>Data Protection Principles at Genies Career Hub</strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                1. **Lawfulness**: We process all personal data legally,
                ensuring we have a lawful basis for all data processing
                activities, such as user consent or contractual necessity.
              </p>

              <p>
                2. **Fairness**: Our data processing is fair, meaning we
                consider the impact on users and do not process data in a way
                that is unduly detrimental, unexpected, or misleading.
              </p>

              <p>
                3. **Transparency**: We are transparent about how we use
                personal data. We communicate with our users clearly and openly
                about their data processing activities.
              </p>

              <p>
                4. **Purpose Limitation**: We collect personal data for
                specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes. We do not process
                data beyond these purposes without further consent from the
                user.
              </p>

              <p>
                5. **Data Minimization**: We ensure that the personal data we
                process is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary
                for the purposes for which it is processed.
              </p>

              <p>
                6. **Accuracy**: We take every reasonable step to keep personal
                data accurate and up to date, and to erase or rectify inaccurate
                data without delay.
              </p>

              <p>
                7. **Storage Limitation**: Personal data is kept in a form that
                permits identification of data subjects for no longer than
                necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is
                processed.
              </p>

              <p>
                8. **Integrity and Confidentiality**: We handle personal data
                securely, protecting it against unauthorized or unlawful
                processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage
                using appropriate technical or organizational measures.
              </p>

              <p>
                By adhering to these principles, Genies Career Hub ensures that
                our users&apos; personal data is managed in a way that respects

                **Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data at Genies Career
                Hub**
              </p>
              <p>
                At Genies Career Hub, we ensure that all personal data
                processing activities have a solid legal foundation. Below are
                the lawful bases we rely upon, in accordance with GDPR:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. **Consent**: We obtain explicit consent from our users for
                processing their personal data for specific purposes. Users have
                the right to withdraw their consent at any time.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. **Contract**: Processing is necessary for the performance of
                a contract to which the user is party, or to take steps at the
                request of the user prior to entering into a contract. 3.
                **Legal Obligation**: We process personal data as required by
                law, such as tax and employment regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                4. **Vital Interests**: Occasionally, we may process personal
                data if it is necessary to protect someone&rsquo;s life, which
                is considered a vital interest.
              </p>
              <p>
                5. **Public Task**: If applicable, we may process personal data
                to perform a task in the public interest or for our official
                functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law.
              </p>
              <p>
                6. **Legitimate Interests**: We process personal data when it is
                necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate
                interests of a third party, provided those interests are not
                overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms
                of the user.
              </p>
              <p>
                By clearly defining these lawful bases, Genies Career Hub
                ensures that our users&apos; personal data is processed
                responsibly and in line with GDPR requirements.

                affirmative actions that signify agreement to the processing of
                personal data. This is typically done via checkboxes or options

                user IDs and manage it through our secure Consent Management
                Platform (CMP), which allows users to easily review and change
                their consent preferences at any time.

                <strong>Data Security</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                We employ a range of technical and organizational measures to

                At Genies Career Hub, we understand that your career path may
                take many turns, and there may be periods of inactivity on your
                account. We want to assure you that even during these times, we
                handle your personal data with care and in compliance with GDPR.
              </p>

              <p>**Retention of Inactive Accounts: **</p>
              <p>
                For accounts that have become inactive, we will retain personal
                data for a period of **seven years**. This duration aligns with
                our legal and regulatory requirements, ensuring that we can
                support any future queries or claims related to your career

              <p>**Review and Deletion: **</p>
              <p>
                We regularly review inactive accounts and the data associated
                with them. If an account remains inactive for seven years, we
                will take steps to securely delete or anonymize the personal
                data, unless we are required to retain it for legal reasons.

                our services. We respect your decision and will process such

              <p>
                You will always be informed about any third-party data sharing,
                and where possible, we will seek your explicit consent. You have
                the right to object to the sharing of your data with third
                parties, except where it is a legal requirement.

              </p>

              <p>**Compliance with GDPR: **</p>
              <p>
                Any transfer of personal data outside of the European Economic
                Area (EEA) is done in full compliance with the General Data
                Protection Regulation (GDPR). We take all necessary steps to
                ensure that your data is protected to the same standard as it
                would be within the EEA.
              </p>

              <p>**Safeguards: **</p>
              <p>We implement robust safeguards, including:</p>
              <p>
                - Ensuring that the country to which we transfer personal data
                has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by
                the European Commission.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Using contractual clauses approved by the European Commission
                that give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
              </p>

              <p>**Your Rights: **</p>
              <p>
                You have the right to be informed of the specific safeguards in
                place for the transfer of your data and to obtain a copy of any
                documentation showing that these protections are in place.

                European Commission.

              <p>- Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) are in place.</p>
